The project is basically, based on designing and testing of 6T SRAM bit cell and the 64 bit memory designed using that bit cell.
The peripherals includes:
i) 3*8 Address Decoder
ii) Precharge circuit 
iii)Column Multiplerxer
iv) Sense Amplifier
v) Write Amplifier
vi) Output Flip FLops (FF)

# The schematic, symbols and testbenches are performed on Cadance virtuoso. So, for accessing these files you must need the Cadence virtuoso license and the software should be installed on your device.

The schematic and symbol files would be present in their respective files.
The main file includes the schematic of the 64 bit SRAM memory.
