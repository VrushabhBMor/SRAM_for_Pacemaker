The project is basically, based on designing and testing of 6T SRAM bit cell and the 64 bit memory designed using that bit cell. <br>
The peripherals includes: <br>
i) 3*8 Address Decoder <br>
ii) Precharge circuit <br>
iii)Column Multiplerxer <br>
iv) Sense Amplifier <br>
v) Write Amplifier <br>
vi) Output Flip FLops (FF) <br>
<br>
The schematic, symbols and testbenches are performed on Cadance virtuoso. <br>
So, for accessing these files you must need the Cadence virtuoso license and the software should be installed on your device.<br>
<br>
The schematic and symbol files would be present in their respective files. <br>
The main file includes the schematic of the 64 bit SRAM memory. <br>
